These text files represents outputs of models for three sites. The files are named as 1000N,
 1000M, 1000S and so on. Number represents the flows example: 1000 means 1000 cfs, letter N,
 M and S means the model for north, middle and south reach respectively. 1000N means the 
results of 1000cfs flow for north reach.

These data don't have the headings. Each column represents x, y, z, depth, velocity, shear 
stress and water surface elevation for all text files.
